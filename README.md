Module 2 - VBA

## Project Overview

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

The goal of this challenge is to refactor the solution code from Module 2 to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

#### Deliverable 1
- [x] 1. The tickerIndex is set equal to zero before looping over the rows
- [x] 2. Arrays are created for tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices
- [x] 3. The tickerIndex is used to access the stock ticker index for the tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices arrays
- [x] 4. The script loops through stock data, reading and storing all of the following values from each row: tickers, tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices
- [x] 5. Code for formatting the cells in the spreadsheet is working

- [x] 6. There are comments to explain the purpose of the code
- [x] 7. The outputs for the 2017 and 2018 stock analyses in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm workbook match the outputs from the AllStockAnalysis in the module

- [x] 8. The pop-up messages showing the elapsed run time for the script are saved as VBA_Challenge_2017.png and VBA_Challenge_2018.png

#### Deliverable 2
- [x] 1. There is a title, and there are multiple paragraphs
- [x] 2. Each paragraph has a heading
- [x] 3. There are subheadings to break up text
- [x] 4. Links are working, and images are formatted and displayed where appropriate
- [x] 5. The purpose and background are well defined
- [x] 6. The analysis is well described with screenshots and code
- [x] 7. There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general
- [x] 8. There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script

## Resources 

- Excel - Version 16.54


## Results

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
